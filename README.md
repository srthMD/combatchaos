# combatchaos

All source code of Combat Chaos managed with Rojo.

Know that this codebase is an absolute mess! I made some poor design choices early on and 
ngl I just dont really like lua or luau that much.

**Included**
* Client folder under StarterPlayerScripts (../src/client)
* Server folder in ServerStorage (../src/server)
* Packages in ReplicatedStorage (../Packages)

I kinda forgot what clientshared and servershared are lol.
